To run the simulator with all predictors for a single trace file, please type in the terminal while being in the project directory:

	python3 default_sim.py path_to_trace_file table_size shift_register_size threshold

or for default variable values: 

	python3 default_sim.py path_to_trace_file

##################################################################################################

The trace files are stored in the director called "traces", similarly with benchmarks and experimental results.

Three benchmarks were writen by me: hello, fibonacci and oddeven. The others were found online and appropriate comments are made to provide credit in the source code.

The result data is stored in the CSV file format and can be re-generated by running these scripts:

bench_sim.py - runs all benchmarks on all of the predictors
var_reg_corre.py - runs all the benchmarks on different register sizes for Correlating predictor
var_reg_gshare.py - runs all the benchmarks on different register sizes for GShare predictor
var_table_two_bit.py - runs all the benchmarks on different table sizes for TwoBit predictor
var_threshold_prof.py - runs all the benchmarks on different threshold values for Profile predictor
